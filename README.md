# OnionDash
Redirect geometry dash requests to the TOR proxy.

When this dll is injected, and the TOR proxy is initialized on port 9050, every gd request will be sent thru the TOR proxy, giving the connection more security and allowing connections to GDPSes hosted on the deep web. This is more of a POC rather than a full working project.

To build it, you need Visual Studio 2017.
